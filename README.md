These are the code files containing my solutions to problems sets from a theory of programming languages course. In particular, this course focused on why languages are
designed the way they are, and how design choices in languages lend themselves to different styles of programming, primarily by contrasting functional and object-oriented programming.

Languages learned in this course were:
SML,
Racket (Lisp-family language),
Ruby
